# Hello I'm Edrisa Jobe!

# My Story
I was born in the small West African country known as Gambia where I lived for about the age of 5 before moving to America. Coming here has been life changing, I've experienced so much and 
feel blessed to be able to have many of the emenities my brothers and sisters back home could only dream of. Thus begins my journey to try and make a change in a way that many can see. My passion
for web development and seeing how cruel the world can be made me develop my ideas and turn them into reality to be displayed for the world. Although I have much more to learn, I want to work
alongside some of the most brightests individuals and be apart of a team that wants to do good for the world one step at a time. Companies that uplift their fellow brothers and sisters in order
to make a better future through the technology of their services. I'm here to be apart of that change and to imprint my hands to leave a legacy of beautiful and inspiring work behind.
